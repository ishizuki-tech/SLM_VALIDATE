  "analysis": "The answer is highly vague and lacks specificity. It's a very general response. It’s usable for a quick, basic assessment, but it doesn’t provide any quantitative data or reasoning. It’s not detailed enough to answer the question meaningfully. The statement 'Most of them came up fine' is insufficient – it doesn’t indicate the *percentage* of healthy plants expected."
}
```

### Stage `p2` — 📝 Input

The statement about 'counted against my target spacing' is also unclear and doesn't provide a quantifiable metric.
