  "analysis": "The answer is somewhat specific but lacks detail. It states a percentage for germination and seedling stage, but doesn't provide any context about the conditions (soil type, climate, etc.) that would influence this percentage. It's usable for a general estimate, but could be improved with more nuanced language. The answer is also quite vague – ‘healthy plants’ is a broad term.  It would benefit from quantifying the expected success rate further."
}
```

### Stage `p2` — 📝 Input
```text
Inspect the Question, Answer, and prior Analysis. Decide whether the Answer contains enough information to fully and practically address the Question.
Assess: coverage of all asked parts, concrete specifics (numbers, names, steps, conditions), reasoning/evidence, stated assumptions, constraints/edge cases, and actionability.

```

### Stage `p1` — 💡 Output
```text
{
  "analysis": "The answer is specific and usable. It clearly states the variation observed (±5%) and the location of that variation (across plots). It's a concise and understandable response to the question."
}
```

### Stage `p2` — 📝 Input
```text
Inspect the Question, Answer, and prior Analysis. Decide whether the Answer contains enough information to fully and practically address the Question.
Assess: coverage of all asked parts, concrete specifics (numbers, names, steps, conditions), reasoning/evidence, stated assumptions, constraints/edge cases, and actionability.

### Stage `p2` — 💡 Output
```text
{
  "analysis": "The answer provides sufficient detail to address the question, though it lacks context. It doesn't specify *which* plots were examined, nor does it quantify the variation (e.g., standard deviation). It's a good starting point but could be strengthened with more specifics."
}
```

### Stage `p3` — 📝 Input
```text
Output ONLY raw JSON on a SINGLE LINE. Any other text is invalid. The first character must be '{' and the last must be '}'. No prose. Do NOT include ```json, ``` or any code fences. Never output placeholders like <label> or <string>. If uncertain, use "Medium".
Task: Judge how well the Answer addresses the Question using the Question, Answer, and Analysis.
Allowed labels for all fields: Very High, High, Medium, Low, Very Low.
Required JSON keys: detail, specificity, usability, clarity, completeness, relevance. Each key must map to one allowed label.
If conflicts exist between Analysis and the actual Q&A, prioritize the Q&A.
