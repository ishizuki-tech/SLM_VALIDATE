      Inspect the following Question and Answer.
      Task: Provide a short evaluation of the Answer, focusing only on specificity, detail, and usability, plus main weaknesses.

      Output ONLY raw JSON on a SINGLE LINE. Any other text is invalid.
      The first character must be '{{' and the last must be '}}'.
      Do NOT include ```json, ``` or any code fences.
      Never output placeholders like <label> or <string>. If uncertain, use "Medium".

      Allowed labels: Very High, High, Medium, Low, Very Low.
      Required JSON keys (4 total): specificity, detail, usability, weaknesses.
      Rules:
      - specificity, detail, usability → one allowed label each.
      - weaknesses → short free-text string (≤ 140 chars).
      - Never output an empty string or placeholder for weaknesses.

      Example:
      {{"specificity":"Low","detail":"Medium","usability":"Low","weaknesses":"Too vague and lacks numeric values."}}

      Inspect the Question, Answer, and prior Analysis.
      Task: Decide whether the Answer contains enough information to fully and practically address the Question.
      Assess based on: coverage of all asked parts, concrete specifics (numbers, names, steps, conditions), reasoning/evidence, stated assumptions, constraints/edge cases, and actionability.

      Output ONLY raw JSON on a SINGLE LINE. Any other text is invalid.
      The first character must be '{{' and the last must be '}}'.
      Do NOT include ```json, ``` or any code fences.
      Never output placeholders like <label> or <string>. If uncertain, use "Medium".

      Allowed labels: Very High, High, Medium, Low, Very Low.
      Required JSON keys (4 total): completeness, clarity, relevance, weaknesses.
      Rules:
      - completeness, clarity, relevance → one allowed label each.
      - weaknesses → short free-text string (≤ 140 chars).
      - Never output an empty string or placeholder for weaknesses.

      Example:
      {{"completeness":"Low","clarity":"Medium","relevance":"High","weaknesses":"No numeric target and lacks supporting context."}}

      Output ONLY raw JSON on a SINGLE LINE. Any other text is invalid.
      The first character must be '{{' and the last must be '}}'.
      No prose. Do NOT include ```json, ``` or any code fences.
      Never output placeholders like <label> or <string>. If uncertain, use "Very Low".
      Task: Judge how well the Answer addresses the Question using the Question, Answer, and Analysis.

      Allowed labels: Very High, High, Medium, Low, Very Low.
      Required JSON keys (7 total): detail, specificity, usability, clarity, completeness, relevance, overall_score.
      
      Rules:

      - detail, specificity, usability, clarity, completeness, relevance → one allowed label each, chosen ONLY from the Allowed labels.
        Allowed labels: Very High, High, Medium, Low, Very Low.

      - overall_score → MUST be computed, not guessed. Strictly follow this procedure:
          Convert each label to a number: Very High=95, High=80, Medium=60, Low=40, Very Low=20.
          Take the average of all 6 values with equal weight.
          Round to the nearest integer.
          Clamp the result to 0–100.
          Never output an overall_score that is inconsistent with the 6 labels.
