No prose.\nQuestion: How uniform was germination across the field?\nAnswer: Germination was fairly uniform, about ±5% variation across plots.\nAnalysis: {\n  \"analysis\": \"The answer is specific and usable. It clearly states the variation observed (±5%) and the location of that variation (across plots). It's a concise and understandable response to the question.\"\n}\n"}
