{"id": "q001", "question": "After planting, what share of seeds do you expect to grow into healthy plants?","answer":"I expect about 70% to germinate and roughly 60% to reach healthy seedling stage."}
{"id": "q002", "question": "How many weeks until seedlings are ready to transplant?","answer":"Typically 3 to 4 weeks, depending on temperature and watering."}
{"id": "q003", "question": "Did you use treated seed or untreated seed?","answer":"We used treated seed coated with fungicide."}
{"id": "q004", "question": "What is your expected survival rate under drought conditions?","answer":"Under severe drought I would estimate 30-40% survival; with occasional rains maybe 60%."}
{"id": "q005", "question": "Describe any problems observed after emergence.","answer":"Some damping-off in low patches and several seedlings were damaged by birds on the first night."}
{"id": "q006", "question": "What fertilizer regimen did you use?","answer":"We applied NPK (10-20-10) at planting and side-dressed with urea (46%) three weeks later."}
{"id": "q007", "question": "How uniform was germination across the field?","answer":"Germination was fairly uniform, about ±5% variation across plots."}
{"id": "q008", "question": "Did you perform any pest control measures?","answer":"Yes — one foliar spray for aphids at 2 weeks and manual removal of caterpillars."}
{"id": "q009", "question": "How deep were the seeds planted?","answer":"Planted at approximately 2.5 cm depth in well-prepared seedbeds."}
{"id": "q010", "question": "Anything else to note about planting conditions?","answer":"Soil was loamy with good drainage; night temps were around 15–18°C during emergence."}
{"id": "q011", "question": "How many weeks until seedlings are ready to transplant?", "answer": "Typically 3 to 4 weeks, depending on temperature and watering."}
{"id": "q012", "question": "Describe any problems observed after emergence.", "answer": "Some damping-off in low patches and several seedlings were damaged by birds on the first night."}
{"id": "q013", "question": "What is your expected survival rate under drought conditions?", "answer": "Under severe drought I would estimate 30-40% survival; with occasional rains maybe 60%."}
{"id": "q014", "question": "How many weeks until seedlings are ready to transplant?", "answer": "About 3 weeks under ideal greenhouse conditions."}

{"id": "q016", "question": "Anything else to note about planting conditions?", "answer": "We planted after light rains; soil moisture was optimal for germination."}
{"id": "q017", "question": "After planting, what share of seeds do you expect to grow into healthy plants?", "answer": "I expect about 70% to germinate and roughly 60% to reach healthy seedling stage."}
{"id": "q018", "question": "How many weeks until seedlings are ready to transplant?", "answer": "Typically 3 to 4 weeks, depending on temperature and watering."}
{"id": "q019", "question": "What is your expected survival rate under drought conditions?", "answer": "Hard to be exact, but roughly 35-55% depending on severity."}
{"id": "q020", "question": "Anything else to note about planting conditions?", "answer": "Soil was loamy with good drainage; night temps were around 15–18°C during emergence."}
{"id": "q021", "question": "How deep were the seeds planted?", "answer": "Planted at approximately 2.5 cm depth in well-prepared seedbeds."}
{"id": "q022", "question": "How deep were the seeds planted?", "answer": "About 1 to 3 cm depending on seed size; average ~2 cm."}
{"id": "q023", "question": "What is your expected survival rate under drought conditions?", "answer": "If drought persists, survival could be as low as 25%; with light rains around 50%."}
{"id": "q024", "question": "Anything else to note about planting conditions?", "answer": "We planted after light rains; soil moisture was optimal for germination."}
{"id": "q025", "question": "After planting, what share of seeds do you expect to grow into healthy plants?", "answer": "I expect about 70% to germinate and roughly 60% to reach healthy seedling stage."}
{"id": "q026", "question": "How uniform was germination across the field?", "answer": "There were some low spots with poorer germination, overall ~10% variability."}
